			<h2>Passwords</h2>
			
			<p>
				Passwords are your computer's and personal information's first line of protection against unwanted access. Your computer will be safer from hackers and bad
				malware if your password is strong. For all accounts on your computer, you should use strong passwords.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Humans are bad at making strong passwords. We  choose difficult-to-remember passwords that are simple for machines to guess, as shown in the xkcd comic below.
			</p>

			<p>
				When choosing passwords, most people follow common patterns, basing  them on things we can recall, such as names, addresses, dates, or simple English words.
				Then we might add a capital letter, some numerals, or a symbol. However, these kinds of passwords are difficult to remember and very easy for a computer to
				guess.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Instead of selecting passwords that are weak, hard to type, and hard to remember, people use passphrases. Longer than a typical password, simple to remember,
				and tough to crack, a passphrase is a string of random words used in place of a password (e.g. <i>CorrectHorseBatteryStaple</i>). To make a passphrase even more
				secure, and to comply with password policy restrictions such special characters and capital letters, letters can be replaced with numbers or symbols while
				spaces can be added.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				A random passphrase will improve your security and is just as hard to crack compared to randomly generated characters and basic passwords.

				<i>"The whole notion of passwords is based on an oxymoron. The idea is to have a random string that is easy to remember. Unfortunately, if it’s easy to
					remember, it’s something nonrandom like ‘Susan’. And if it’s random, like ‘r7U2*Qnp’ then it’s not easy to remember."</i>
