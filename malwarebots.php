			<p><strong>What are viruses?</strong></p>
			
			<p>
				Viruses are malicious programs that can infect computers and other linked devices in a variety of ways. Viruses differ in lots of ways, but they always have the
				same goal: to spread from one device to another and create problems. Viruses are often designed to provide the criminals who produce them access to the infected
				devices in some way.
			</p>
			
			<p><strong>What are botnets?</strong></p>
			
			<p>
				Botnets are computer networks infiltrated by malware (such as viruses, spyware, and other malicious software) and remotely controlled by criminals, primarily
				for financial gain or to conduct assaults on websites or networks. Many botnets are designed to collect data such as passwords, SSNs, credit card numbers,
				addresses, phone numbers, and other sensitive information. Identity theft, credit card fraud, spamming (sending junk email), website assaults, and virus
				spreading are all examples of how the data is utilised.
			</p>
			
			<p><strong>What is spyware?</strong></p>
			
			<p>
				Spyware can install itself on your computer without your consent when you open an unsafe website or attachment. It could force your computer to perform actions
				you don't want to do and even track what you do online, steal your login details, and jeopardise your online accounts.
