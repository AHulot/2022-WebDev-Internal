			<h2>Avoiding and Spotting Scams</h2>
			
			<p>
				Most scams have some similar characteristics that can make it easier for people to tell if they are being scammed. Knowing these signs will help avoid being
				scammed in the future. Here is a list of them.
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Sudden contact that comes out of nowhere.</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Being told there's an issue with your device or network when there is/have been none.</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Attempts to get you to use a website/app outside of the normal site or app</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Being asked for your password. (No legitimate organisation or business will ask for passwords.)</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Money or a gift being offered in exchange for payment upfront</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Being asked to pay for something in an unusual way</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Asking for remote access to your device</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong>Pressuring you into making quick decisions</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				Think carefully before handing out any personal information to anyone. If you think you are being scammed, do some extra research on the information being given
				by the potential scammer to see if it is genuine or not.
