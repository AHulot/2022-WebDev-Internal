			<h3>1. Use Secure Devices to Protect Personal Information</h3>

			<p>
				Protect your devices using security options like passwords, screen locks, or fingerprint readers. This will help prevent anyone from accessing your own private 				information.
			</p>

			<h3>2. Use Strong Passwords</h3>

			<p>
				Make sure your password meets the requirement of a strong password. Try to include capital letters, symbols, or punctuation to make your password unique and 					hard to guess. Do not share these passwords with other people and make sure to change them often. <a href="passwords.php"><i>More about passwords…</i></a>
			</p>

			<h3>3. Update Apps and Software</h3>

			<p>
				When software and apps are updated, bugs and security issues are often fixed. By updating your apps and software, the software and apps you use will become more 				reliable and secure. This can help reduce exposure to viruses and malware. <a href="malwarebots.php"><i>More about malware…</i></a>

			<h3>4. Use Secure Wifi Networks</h3>

			<p>
				Public wifi is usually unsafe to use. Through unsecured wifi, hackers might be able to send malware to your device or access personal information. It is better 				to avoid using any public wifi. Any wifi networks you own should be secured with a strong password that should be changed often and not shared with anyone else.
			</p>

			<h3>5. Back Up and Save All Personal Data</h3>

			<p>
				In case of an emergency, back up any important personal information on external hard drives. This will allow you to save your important information in case you 				happen to lose all the data on your device.

				<i>"History has taught us: never underestimate the amount of money, time, and effort someone will expend to thwart a security system. It’s always better to
					assume the worst. Give yourself a margin for error. Give yourself more security than you need today. When the unexpected happens, you’ll be glad you did."
