				Personal information is valuable, and our devices can contain lots of it through photos, videos, messages, and contact lists. To prevent information from being
				stolen, it is important to know some privacy basics:
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Disable WiFi and Bluetooth when you aren't using it.</strong> This will prevent your movement from being tracked when you are in range.</li>
				<li><strong>Avoid using public WiFi.</strong> Because public wifi networks and hotspots are insecure, anybody might possibly see what you're doing on your phone
					while you're connected.</li>
				<li><strong>Be careful of what apps are allowed to collect information.</strong> Delete any apps that aren't in use.</li>
				<li><strong>Use security features</strong> such as passwords to lock your devices and protect your information.</li>
			</ul>
